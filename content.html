      <p2 class="essayheadline"> VOCAULARY & suggestions</p2>
      <p class="essaytext"> <br> As a result of the rise of push notifications in our operating systems, a new set of words creeped into our lives. Cold, efficient and systematic language was implemented into everyday use. These “straight to the
        point” words disregard any moment of reflection or emotion that one may experience. All decisions seem final and may not encompass the range of possible motives. Therefore I decided to conduct a survey and collect the determinations and
        reasons that those questioned feel would better sum up their interactions with push notifications.
